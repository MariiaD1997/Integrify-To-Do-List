# To-do list

You can see my to-do list [here](https://mariiad1997.github.io/Integrify-To-Do-List/)
This is one of fun and interesting projects that I have done at start of my studying as a student of Integrify. It is a simple to do list where you can create a list of tasks where each of them has unqiue title, possibility of choose status and edit the whole task.
This project helped me to better understand Javascript logic and practice my CSS knowledges.
