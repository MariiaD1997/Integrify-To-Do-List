# To-do list

Create a simple application to let users add/remove/edit tasks.
Tasks should have: title, deadline, status

* title should be unique
* deadline should be a date in the future
* status is one of 3 options : `["not started", "in progress", "done"]`
* form to add/edit tasks should be opened/closed by clicking on a button (see the screenshot below)
